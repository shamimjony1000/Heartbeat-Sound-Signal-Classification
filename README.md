# Heartbeat-Sound-Signal-Classification

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying heartbeat sounds into one of two categories: normal or abnormal. The project is implemented using Python and TensorFlow.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains audio recordings of heartbeat sounds. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Architecture

The deep learning model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by a fully connected output layer. The model is trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
Results

The model was able to achieve high accuracy on the test set:

    Test Accuracy: 93.0%
